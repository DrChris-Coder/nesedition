lbl2nl converts the output .lbl file from the cl65 assembler to a
.nes.0.nl file which is the labels format that the fceux debugger requires.
It's automatically run as part of the tasks.json build process.

To build from the terminal window use:
gcc -o ./tools/lbl2nl/lbl2nl ./tools/lbl2nl/lbl2nl.cpp

Then to give access in the codespaces environment use:
chmod +x ./tools/lbl2nl/lbl2nl
